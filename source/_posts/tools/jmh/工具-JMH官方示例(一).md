     * This is our first benchmark method.
     *
     * JMH works as follows: users annotate the methods with @Benchmark, and
     * then JMH produces the generated code to run this particular benchmark as
     * reliably as possible. In general one might think about @Benchmark methods
     * as the benchmark "payload", the things we want to measure. The
     * surrounding infrastructure is provided by the harness itself.
     *
     * Read the Javadoc for @Benchmark annotation for complete semantics and
     * restrictions. At this point we only note that the methods names are
     * non-essential, and it only matters that the methods are marked with
     * @Benchmark. You can have multiple benchmark methods within the same
     * class.
     *
     * Note: if the benchmark method never finishes, then JMH run never finishes
     * as well. If you throw an exception from the method body the JMH run ends
     * abruptly for this benchmark and JMH will run the next benchmark down the
     * list.
     *
     * Although this benchmark measures "nothing" it is a good showcase for the
     * overheads the infrastructure bear on the code you measure in the method.
     * There are no magical infrastructures which incur no overhead, and it is
     * important to know what are the infra overheads you are dealing with. You
     * might find this thought unfolded in future examples by having the
     * "baseline" measurements to compare against.

     * harness overheads per method call. In most of our measurements, it is
     * down to several cycles per call.
     *
     * a) Via command-line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_01
     *
     * JMH generates self-contained JARs, bundling JMH together with it.
     * The runtime options for the JMH are available with "-h":
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -h
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)

     * well beyond what hardware can actually do.
     *
     * This happens because the loop is heavily unrolled/pipelined, and the operation
     * to be measured is hoisted from the loop. Morale: don't overuse loops, rely on JMH
     * to get the measurement right.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_11 -f 1
     *    (we requested single fork; there are also other options, see -h)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
